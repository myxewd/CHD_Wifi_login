# CHD_Wifi_login
A python script monitoring WIFI connection to CHD-Wifi and automaticlly reconnect to it.

Before you use , please configurate the username (stu.NO) and the password in the file.
Then , create a timed task to call to this script.

If you want to use it on your PC , please consider downloading older version . The latest version is just for my router and can only work normally on Linux !
